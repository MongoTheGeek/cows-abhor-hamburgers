Cows Abhor Hamburgers
=====================
Cows Abhor Hamburgers is an unofficial expansion for
[Cards Against Humanity](http://cardsagainsthumanity.com). These templates
can be used to create custom cards that are suitable for professional
printing.

The resulting cards are 2.5 x 3.5 inches. The template includes margin and
bleed areas to ensure all text appears on the final card.

The "Neue HelveticaÂ® Std 75 Bold" font is used to match the Cards Against
Humanity style as closely as possible. The font can be purchased from
